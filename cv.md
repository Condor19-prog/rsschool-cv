### Summary
  By the age of 22, I realized that what
  I was doing in life did not please me and realized that
  I would like to connect my life with what was always
  close to me. Therefore, I spend all my free
  time on improving my knowledge in the field
  of programming and the English language,
  because my goal is to become a Front-end developer.

### Skills

Git, Java, JavaScript, HTML & CSS, BootStrap 3-4,
Android, Dagger2, RxJava2, MVVM, MVP, SQL. 
``` Java

String str = "";
int sec = 60;
int count = 2;
for (int i = 3; i > 0; i--) {
int p = seconds;
int r = (int) Math.pow(sec, count);
count--;
p /= r;
if (p >= 0 && p < 10) {
str += "0" + p + ":";
} else {
str += p + ":";
}
p *= r;
seconds -= p;
}
str = str.substring(0, 8);
return str;
}
